<p>In my last blog post, we had a look at <a href="/blog/using-eloquent-outside-laravel">using Eloquent outside laravel</a>. One of the great things about Eloquent is Migrations. It's like a version control for your database schema. Laravel comes with this useful command line tool called <code>artisan</code>, which makes it easy to make and run migrations. Since I was using Eloquent outside laravel, I had this (crazy) idea of trying to use the migration <code>artisan</code> commands along with it (i.e outside laravel).</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Eloquent suggests installing <code>illuminate\console</code> and <code>illuminate\filesystem</code> to run the migration commands. So I update my <code>composer.json</code> accordingly and installed the requierd packages.</p>
<p>I made a file called <code>artsy</code> and put the following content in it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
require_once &quot;vendor/autoload.php&quot;;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Application;

$app = new Application(&quot;Artsy, little brother of Artisan&quot;, &quot;1.0&quot;);

$app-&gt;run();
</code></pre>
<h2>Including commands</h2>
<p>My first aim was to add  <code>migrate:install</code> and <code>make:migrate</code> commands which would insert required migration tables to the database and run migrations respectively. After going through the database component's code, I realized that the components have a crazy dependency on each other and required a lot of boostrapping (which is obviously handled by Laravel internally). To ease this task a bit, I decided to use <code>Pimple</code>.</p>
<p>After a bit struggle, I finally figured out the dependencies and also that I'll need to mock <code>Illuminate\Foundation\Composer</code> for <code>make:migrate</code> command. So I also included <code>Mockery</code>. And after all this my <code>artsy</code> file looked like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
require_once &quot;vendor/autoload.php&quot;;

use Symfony\Component\Console\Application;
use Illuminate\Database\Console\Migrations;
use Pimple\Container;

$container = new Container();

$container['migration-table'] = 'migration';

$container['db-config'] = [
    'driver'    =&gt; 'pgsql',
    'host'      =&gt; 'localhost',
    'database'  =&gt; 'dummy',
    'username'  =&gt; 'postgres',
    'password'  =&gt; 'postgres',
    'charset'   =&gt; 'utf8',
    'prefix'    =&gt; '',
    'schema'   =&gt; 'public'
];

$container['filesytem'] = function ($c) {
    return new \Illuminate\Filesystem\Filesystem;
};

$container['composer'] = function ($c) {
    $composer = Mockery::mock('Illuminate\Foundation\Composer');
    $composer-&gt;shouldReceive('dumpAutoloads');
    return $composer;
};

$container['connection'] = function ($c) {
    $manager = new \Illuminate\Database\Capsule\Manager();
    $manager-&gt;addConnection($c['db-config']);
    $manager-&gt;setAsGlobal();
    $manager-&gt;bootEloquent();
    return $manager-&gt;getConnection('default');
};

$container['resolver'] = function ($c) {
    $r = new \Illuminate\Database\ConnectionResolver(['default' =&gt; $c['connection']]);
    $r-&gt;setDefaultConnection('default');
    return $r;
};

$container['migration-repo'] = function ($c) {
    return new \Illuminate\Database\Migrations\DatabaseMigrationRepository($c['resolver'], $c['migration-table']);
};

$container['migration-creator'] = function ($c) {
    return new \Illuminate\Database\Migrations\MigrationCreator($c['filesytem']);
};

$container['migrator'] = function ($c) {
    return new Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migrator($c['migration-repo'], $c['resolver'], $c['filesytem']);
};

$container['install-command'] = function ($c) {
    $command = new Migrations\InstallCommand($c['migration-repo']);
    return $command;
};

$container['migrate-make-command'] = function ($c) {
    $command = new Migrations\MigrateMakeCommand($c['migration-creator'], $c['composer']);
    return $command;
};

$app = new Application(&quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;1.0&quot;);
$app-&gt;add($container['install-command']);
$app-&gt;add($container['migrate-make-command']);

<p>Now running on running <code>php artsy</code>, showed me:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Artsy, little brother of Artisan 1.0

Usage:
 [options] command [arguments]

Options:
 --help (-h)           Display this help message
 --quiet (-q)          Do not output any message
 --verbose (-v|vv|vvv) Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug
 --version (-V)        Display this application version
 --ansi                Force ANSI output
 --no-ansi             Disable ANSI output
 --no-interaction (-n) Do not ask any interactive question

Available commands:
 help              Displays help for a command
 list              Lists commands
make
 make:migration    Create a new migration file
migrate
 migrate:install   Create the migration repository
</code></pre>
<p>Everything looked good till now. But upon running <code>php artsy migrate:install</code>, I got the following error.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">PHP Fatal error:  Call to a member function call() on null in E:\demo\vendor\illuminate\console\Command.php on line 115

</code></pre>
<p>Upon inspecting <code>Command.php</code> in <code>illuminate\console</code> package, I found that the follwing line (L115) was the culprit.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">return $this-&gt;laravel-&gt;call([$this, $method]);
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, a whole instance of <code>laravel</code> is required even for running a simple console command!!!!</p>
<p>I tried mocking it too but the command did not do anything as expected and I could not think of a way to do it (with my limited knowledge of PHP) without implementing the whole <code>Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application</code> interface with 20+ methods.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Laravel components are not as flexible or should I say loosely couple as that of Symfony's. I wish they had been, but I'm no Taylor Otwell.</p>
<p>This was me just trying out some crazy idea and trying to learn stuff. If any one of you know a better solution, I would really like to discuss it. You can leave a comment below or tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/_vkbansal">@_vkbansal</a></p>
