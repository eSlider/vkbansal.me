<p>Hello readers, as you can guess from the title, this is my first blog post and this one of my new year resoultions for 2015. I've put together a list of goals, that I've set for myself and hopefully publishing this to keep myself on track. So here we go...</p>
<p>###Learn AngularJS
I know! It's the &quot;cool kid on the block&quot; that everyone should know. But I didn't get a chance to do so. Sure, I've fiddled around with it, but not to an extent where I can call myself &quot;Angular developer&quot;. Even at work, we use <em>backbone.js</em>. So, this year, I've decided to give it a go and try to learn the ins and outs of it. I've also read about Angular 2.0, which will be a major shift from Angular 1.x.. But what the heck, I love learning new stuff and this shall not stop me.</p>
<p>###Create a useful, popular open source project
This may sound stereotypical, but I really want to build an open source project which can be useful not only for me but to others too. I feel, I'm already on this path with my php port of <a href="http://prismjs.com">prism.js</a>,  which I named <a href="https://github.com/vkbansal/prism.php">prism.php</a> (obviously). Once it's stable enough, I'll intergrate it in this very site and you can see it in action. If you are interested, you can grab a peek at it <a href="http://vkbansal.github.io/prism.php/">here</a>.</p>
<p>###Learn NodeJS
It's not that I haven't started learning NodeJS. I've created a couple of gulp plugins as a learning process but I'm still far away to call myself a &quot;Node Developer&quot;.</p>

<p>###Keep writing
I've been postponing writing a blog since long. But, now I shall try to write at least a couple of blogs per month.</p>
<p>###Excercise
This is a never ending struggle but I really want to do this. It would be the most difficult task for me and I must complete it.</p>
<p>###And You?
These were my goals. What are yours? Let me know in the comments below or at twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/_vkbansal">@_vkbansal</a></p>
