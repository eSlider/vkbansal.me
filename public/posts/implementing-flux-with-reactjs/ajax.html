<h1>Implementing Flux with ReactJS</h1>
<p>Flux is an application architecture developed by facebook for building client-side web application utilizing a unidirectional data flow. As the <a href="http://facebook.github.io/flux/">flux website</a> states: it's more of pattern rather than a formal framework. You can head over to their website to learn more about it.</p>
<p>With increase in popularity of ReactJS, there was a explosion in the amount of packages for implementing flux. After a lot of research, I setteled down with <a href="http://alt.js.org/">Alt</a>. The main selling point of alt for me was less amount of boiler-plate code and ES6.</p>
<h2>What we will be building</h2>
<p>We'll be building a very simple TODO list (I like to call it the new &quot;Hello World&quot; of JavaScript). You can have a look at <a href="http://vkbansal.github.io/learn-flux/">live demo</a>.</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>If you don't want to read the entire tutorial, you can <a href="https://github.com/vkbansal/learn-flux/archive/master.zip">download the source code</a>. You'll need Node.js/io.js, npm and gulp to run it.
Assuming that you have, here is what you need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/vkbansal/learn-flux/archive/master.zip">zip file</a> with the source code.</li>
<li>Extract it to a folder somewhere on your computer.</li>
<li>Open terminal/command-prompt, and navigate to that folder.</li>
<li>Run <code>npm install</code>. This will download and install all dependencies that are needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Run <code>gulp</code> to bundle the app (using browserify) and watch for changes and start a server at <code>http://localhost:8000</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The source code uses ES6 and JSX syntax. See <a href="https://babeljs.io/">babeljs</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The source code is easy to follow, so for those of you who prefer to read the source, you can skip the rest of the article.</p>
<h2>Setting things up</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, we will be using ES6 and JSX for writting React code. There are many tools out there, for the job but my personal choice is <a href="https://github.com/babel/babelify">babelify</a> -- a <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify">browserify</a> transform. This gives us the goodness of ES6, JSX and node.js style <code>require()</code> and the ability to intsall and utilize the awesome collection of libraries from npm.</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy <code>package.json</code> and <code>gulpfile.js</code> from the zip file to you folder and run <code>npm install</code>.</li>
<li>Create a <code>src</code> folder. All our code will go inside this directory.</li>
<li>As stated above, run <code>gulp</code> to bundle the app (using browserify) and watch for changes and start a server at <code>http://localhost:8000</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now lets write some code.</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>Here is the directory stucture, we will be using.</p>
<pre><code class="language-none">src
├── actions
|   └── task-actions.js
├── components
|   ├──
|   └──
├── mixins
|   └── alt-mixin.js
├── stores
|   └── task-store.js
├── alt.js
└── app.js

</code></pre>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>First we need to create an instance of <code>Alt</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">//alt.js
let Alt = require('alt');

module.exports = new Alt();
</code></pre>
<p>Next we'll create an entry point for our app.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">//app.js

</code></pre>
