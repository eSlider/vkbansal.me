### Profile
I’m a frontend developer with about two years of experience in building applications with Backbone.js and React.js Frameworks.

I’m an active proponent of Modern JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5. I love building application agnostic plugins/components using aforementioned technologies. I also like working on backend server using PHP and NodeJS.

My personal development projects include an application agnostic right-click menu (context menu) using React.js and Flux architecture; and a syntax highlighter for NodeJS.
